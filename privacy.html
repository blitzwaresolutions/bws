  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 10, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>BlitzWeather is a software application developed by BlitzWare Solutions LLC ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information when you use BlitzWeather (“App”). By using the App, you agree to the practices described below. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email / Contact Info:</strong> If you submit your email or contact info (e.g., via support forms), we collect it to respond to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> We may collect non-personal usage statistics (e.g., which layers you use, performance logs) to improve the App. These are aggregated and not tied to your identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Only if you grant permission, the App may access your device’s location (latitude/longitude) to display local radar, weather, or alerts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining the App features (e.g., radar, alerts, forecasts).</li>
    <li>Responding to your inquiries, feedback, or support requests.</li>
    <li>Improving and optimizing the App (analytics, debugging, performance).</li>
    <li>Compliance with applicable laws and preventing misuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services & Data Providers</h2>
  <p>To provide the App’s functionality, we integrate with third-party services. When you use the App, the following providers may receive data necessary to serve you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>**RainViewer** (composite radar tiles)</li>
    <li>**OpenWeatherMap (OWM)** — maps, forecasts, geocoding</li>

    <li>Other open or public APIs consumed by the App</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers may see your IP address and, when requested by the App, your location (if you permitted). Those providers manage their own data usage under their privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing & Sale</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information (“personal information” means information that can be used to identify you). We may share aggregated, anonymized usage data internally, but not linked to your identity.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We store your email/contact info only as long as needed to correspond with you. For usage analytics, we retain anonymized logs for performance improvement but not indefinitely.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>~~If you change your mind, you can opt out of location access via your device’s settings at any time.~~</li>

    <li>If your region has data protection laws (e.g. GDPR, CCPA), you may request access, correction, or deletion of your data (if any) under those rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard security measures (e.g., encryption in transit, secure coding practices). However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <p>This App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
